Business Objective: Forecasting is a gem of business strategy, providing organization with a glimpse into the future,  allowing them to prepare for uncertainties, make informed decisions and remain competitive. 

Approach: To predict the sales of a store, by integrating the sales data into the Large Language Model and by 
instructing the LLM to do the forecasts with the help of prompts. To make interactive conversation regarding forecast, 
we have created a chatbot using chainlit.
